Then create a bucket for your project for adding model.

For adding model , i am using colab, u can add your trained model to bucket running this code.

```bash
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.load_model(<your_model_path>)
model.save(<your_model_name>)

## Uploading a model to Google Storage from within Colab ##

# Authorize Colab and initalize gcloud (enter the appropriate inputs when asked)
from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()
!curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
!gcloud init

# Upload SavedModel to Google Storage Bucket
!gsutil cp -r <your_saved_model_path> gs://<your_bucket_name>
```
