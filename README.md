**The fastest way to build and share data apps.**

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It's all Python, open-source, and free! And once you've created an app you can use our [free sharing platform](https://streamlit.io/sharing) to deploy, manage, and share your app with the world.

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit hello
```

Streamlit can also be installed in a virtual environment on [Windows](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-windows), [Mac](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux), and [Linux](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dream4Theater/corona-detect-v1-streamlit-app
